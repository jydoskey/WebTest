# Promo Campaign
Demo website for a promo campaign 

## State

`
Plain HTMl and CSS is being made use of  to produce a lightweight page inorder to optimise for the website performance as it's just a single webview 
`

## Alternatives

`
A framework can be utilised e.g Angular, Vue, Nuxt, Next etc.
`

## Architecture

`
In writing my html, I applied semantic elements while working with less lines of code so as to keep it clean and make it readable.
